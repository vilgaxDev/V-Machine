# Vending Machine
## Project: Create a vending machine utilizing React.js, Node.js, and Express.js

-----------------------
How to Run Project
------------------------------------------
### NOTE: Assuming all correct dependencies are installed
    1. Download repo to local folder
    2. Open two instances of terminal
    3. In terminal 1 change into Vending Machine/server directory
    4. Run command:
        -npm run dev
    5. In terminal 2 change into Vending Machine/client directory
    6. Run command:
        -npm start
    7. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

How to utilize API
------------------------------------------
### In App Display
    1. Once launched navigate to Admin portal
    2. Navigate to Operations
        -List of API requests will be listed along with descriptions
    3. Perform function with POSTMAN at specific URI

### In README:
    1. Get all sodas [GET]:
        Send request to http://localhost:4000/v1/status/sodas
    
    2. Get individual soda by ID [GET]:
        Send soda ID to http://localhost:4000/v1/status/sodas/ID
    
    4. Add new soda [POST]:
        Send JSON to http://localhost:4000/v1/status/sodas/add
        FORMAT for JSON to POST as follows:
        ------------------------
        {
            "name": "NEW DRINK",
            "cost": 20,
            "quantity": 5000,
            "desc": "DELECTABLE."
        }
    
    4. Update soda by ID and send JSON [PUT]:
        Send soda ID to http://localhost:4000/v1/status/sodas/put/ID
        FORMAT for JSON to POST as follows:
        ------------------------
        {
            "name": "NEW NEW DRINK",
            "cost": 5000,
            "quantity": 1,
            "desc": "RARE."
        }
    
    5. Delete soda by ID [DELETE]:
        Send soda ID to http://localhost:4000/v1/status/sodas/delete/ID

How to Recreate Project
------------------------------------------
### 1. Create client side
    1.1 Install global package to create react apps:
        -npm install -g create-react-app
    1.2 Create React.js app by running following command:
        -npx create-react-app client
    1.3 Change into client directory:
        -cd client
    1.4 Command to launch React app:
        -npm start
### 2. Create server side
    2.1 Install nvm:
        -https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
    2.2 Install node lts command:
        -nvm install --lts
    2.3 Install express-generator globally:
        -npm install express-generator -g
    2.4 Create server with ejs flag:
        -express --ejs server
    2.5 Change into server directory:
        -cd server
    2.6 Install nodemon command:
        -npm i nodemon
    2.7 Add script to package.json to run server:
        -"dev": "nodemon www.js",
    2.8 Change port to different value to run same time as client
    2.9 Run server
        -npm run dev

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start in client directory`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
